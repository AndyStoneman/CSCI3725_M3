Title: MarkovTurtle Abstraction
Author: Andy Stoneman
Submission Date: 09/15/2022

Description: A 'MarkovTurtle' object that generates abstract art using a transition matrix to select different 
types of drawing/shapes/artwork. The idea being that this project will generate something new and abstract every
time it is run, mixing both known designs with randomness. 

How to run code: Create a MarkovTurtle object, choose whether to specify the speed, transition matrix, and starting 
shape of the abstract art. Call the draw() method, and art will be created! 

Meaning: This system is meaningful to me because I really enjoy two aspects; 1) the fact that the drawing created
is entirely abstract and is virtually impossible to recreate with the way the program is set up, and 2) I've always 
found particular shapes (the helixes for example) as really visually appealing, so re-creating those was really fun. 
Mixing these two aspects together sometimes creates a blurry mess of colors, but I find it compelling to see the 
possibilities of inspiring shapes combined with abstraction and randomness.

Challenges: I had quite a few challenges doing this. First off, I had to remember A LOT of python details that I 
totally forgot how to do (I've been using Java quite a bit!). Another challenge was familiarizing myself with Turtle
again, and trying to build designs with it. I also had some trouble initially trying to create an object that uses
another object (Turtle, in this case), but was able to figure that out. Another problem I had was setting up a new 
Python Interpreter on the new Mac that the school gave us, as it was not preconfigured. This took far more time than
I anticipated. 

I think these challenges were important because it forced me to learn, re-learn, and discover aspects of Python, 
Turtle, and even my computer system that I didn't know. I also think these challenges were important because when I 
finally got my program working, the abstract art that it created felt even more rewarding, having been through the 
adversity of these challenges. 

As far as this project goes, I think some compelling next steps would be to add more shapes, more customizable features,
and perhaps a way to vary 'abstraction' (i.e. making the drawing more recognizable/typical versus more abstract/unique).
I also think going forward it will be important to carry all of these concepts that I have learned with me, and to 
understand that self-teaching is something I can do, even when it feels like a daunting task. Markov Chains are also
really cool!

Is my system creative?
Honestly, I think my system is really creative, primarily because it is dynamic, and that every time the program is 
run it produces an entirely unique drawing. I also think the combination of familiar shapes with random lines creates
creative abstractions that are compelling to look at. While it does not always produce the most visually compelling
content, this is part of the point, as it is intentionally an abstraction.
